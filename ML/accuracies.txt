The model was trained for 960 frames (80% of the 1200 frames available)
It was tested with 240 frames

All accuracies are in approx because data was diveded randomly on each run

The accuracy scores are :

K Nearest Neighbors:
  Train Data : 0.89
  Test Data : 0.86
Decision Tree:
  Train Data : 0.90
  Test Data : 0.80
Stochastic Gradient Descent (loss : hinge , penalty : l2):
  Train Data : 0.89
  Test Data : 0.84
Support Vector Machine:
  Train Data : 0.90
  Test Data : 0.84

After considering the finger pointing direction the accuracy scores are:
